            <div>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to show more people how to make
                origami while helping them improve their skills and
                promoting
                artists and others in the international paper folding community.
                If you’ve never folded anything before and want to learn how, we have an excellent guide for beginners.
                We
                have
                a giant database of free diagrams and video instrutions too. Our blog features amazing work from a
                variety
                of
                very talented artists, we also have a collection of book reviews and recommendations plus much
                more!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Origami is actually a very easy hobby to pick up and it’s a lot of fun. All you need is paper and you
                can use pretty much any paper you can find. This guide will show you the main folds, the basic bases
                that are used as the foundation for a huge number of different models and then you’ll learn how to fold
                your first model, the traditional paper crane.

                    <li>When camels walk, they move both legs on one side of their body and then the other.</li><br>
                    <li>Their feet are also soft, flat and wide.</li><br>
                    <li>Both of these features help prevent them from sinking into the sand.</li><br>
                    <li>Camels have a double row of very long eyelashes to protect the eye from blowing sand.</li><br>
                    <li>They also have a nictitating membrane, which is a third eyelid for extra protection from sand
                        and
                        dust.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>They have hairs in the opening of the ear to help stop blowing sand from blowing into them.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Camels can also close their nostrils.

                    <li>The largest chameleon is the Parson’s chameleon, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.</li><br>
                    <li>It can grow up to 27 inches (69.5 centimeters) long.</li><br>
                    <li>The Madagascan, also known as the Oustalet's chameleon, is also very large and grows up to 23
                        inches
                        (60

                <div class="fact">
                    <h3>Facts</h3>
                    <li>Cicadas are famous for their penchant for disappearing entirely for many years, only to reappear
                        in
                        force at a regular interval.</li><br>
                    <li>There are four species of 13-year cicadas: Magicicada tredecim, Magicicada neotredecim,
                        Magicicada
                        tredecassini, and Magicicada tredecula.</li><br>
                    <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically
                        accurate.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on
                        the
                        lookout.</li><br>
                    <li>Cicadas are mostly beneficial. They prune mature trees, aerate the soil, and once they die,
                        their
                        bodies
                        serve as an important source of nitrogen for growing trees.</li><br>

                    <h3>Facts</h3>
                    <li>An adult panda weight more than 45 kilos (100 pounds), and can be about 1.5 meters (5 feet)
                        long!
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Giant pandas can't stand and do kung fu moves like Po in Kungfu Panda. But they are good tree
                        climbers.
                        They can climb trees from 7 months old.</li><br>
                    <li>Pandas are born looking like baby badgers — fur-less, pink, and blind. The iconic black and
                        white
                        colour
                        comes later, after about three weeks.</li><br>
                    <li>Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1%
                        of
                        their
                        diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for
                        pumpkin,
                        kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food. </li><br>
                    <li>As about all a panda does all day is eat and sleep, you are best to get up early</li><br>

                    <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li><br>
                    <li>In a 2017 Current Biology study, researchers showed captive pigeons a series of digital lines on
                        a
                        computer screen for either two or eight seconds.</li><br>
                    <li>Some lines were short, measuring about 2.3 inches across; others were four times longer.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The pigeons were trained to evaluate either the length of the line or how long it was displayed.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>They found that the more time a line was displayed, the longer in length the pigeon judged it to
                        be.

                    <h3>Facts</h3>
                    <li>The name teddy bear comes from former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, who was
                        commonly
                        known
                        as "Teddy".</li><br>
                    <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during
                        a
                        1902
                        hunting trip.</li><br>
                    <li>The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.</li><br>
                    <li>Bears first appeared on the literary scene in the fairy tale 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears'
                        written by
                        Robert Southey in 1834.</li><br>
                    <li>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of
                        a
